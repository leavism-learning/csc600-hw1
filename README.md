# HW1

This was homework 1 for CSC 600 Programming Paradigms. The objective of this assignment was to get some practice with TypeScript.

- Your code needs to compile with no errors with
  ```
  tsc --strict --target es2019 --module commonjs hw1.ts
  ```
  If your code does not compile, we will not grade your submission.
- You can run your compiled code with
  ```
  node hw1.js
  ```
